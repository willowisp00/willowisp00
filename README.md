Hi! I'm Crystal (Preferred name is WIll) and my pronouns are they/them!

______

I am currently learning css, javascript, and python in hopes to apply it to projects or future jobs I might have!

______

Fun facts about me: I've been drawing since I was a little kid, I can play the ukulele and piano, and I hope to become an animator, game developer, or game artist.

______

I don't have pictures of the game I'm making, but I do have concept art for scenes I want to make.

Concept art:
